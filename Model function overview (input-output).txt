Overview IJsel model

- Input functions:
	- funs_hydrostat.py --> draws CDF functions for discharge? But where is the discharge input specified

	- funs_generate_network.py generates the network of nodes (not really a network as in discrete, but specifies nodes to store information in it)
		--> Just loads in a lot of data from the excel files 

	- funs_dikes.py --> determines if dikes are failed or not 
		
		input:
			dikefailure(sb, inflow, hriver, hbas, hground, status_t1,
                	Bmax, Brate, simtime, tbreach, critWL)
			
`			Function establising dike failure as well as flow balance between the
        		river and the polder

        		inflow = flow coming into the node
         		status = if False the dike has not failed yet
         		critWL = water level above which we have failure

		output: outflow, breachflow, status_t2, tbr

	- funs_economy.py:
		input: 
			cost_fun(ratio, c, b, lambd, dikeinit, dikeincrease)
			discount_fun(amount, rate, n)
			cost_evacuation(N_evacuated, days_to_threat)
		output:
			cost of raising dikes
			discount due to planning period --> cost in the future are weighted as less then spending the money now
			cost of evacuation
			 

- Output parameters
	- Expected Annual Damage --> computed per node
	- Dike Investment Costs --> computed per node
	- RfR Investment costs --> computed per node 
	- Evacuation costs --> computed for the total model
	- Expected number of Deaths --> computed for the total model
